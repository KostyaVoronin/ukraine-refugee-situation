This project is based on the Ukraine Refugee Situation data feed made available by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). UNHCR's institutional responsibility is to provide information and a data-sharing platform to facilitate the coordination of refugee emergencies.

This page fetches the most up-to-date information from the UNHCR feed and presents it in a summarized form using various Python data and geospatial analysis packages, such as Pandas, Geopandas, Folium, Matplotlib, etc.

Information provided in the "Dynamically Updated Content" section is updated in real-time.

See the post providing a summary of this project on my website at [kostya.io](https://kostya.io/portfolio/ukraine_refugee_situation).
